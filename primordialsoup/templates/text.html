<p><br/><br/><b>Diagram of Funen Art Academy's reconfigured network</b><br/><br/></p>

<p>This is a simplified diagram of the reconfigured network belonging to the Funen Art Academy, acting temporary data center.<br/><br/></p>

<p>From your arbitrary location (WAN/world) you can access ursuppe.dk* (5.186.82.172). From your arbitrary location, you will be routed to the academy's computer network. You are now on the academy's local network (LAN/institution) connected to its router, behind the walls at Jernbanegade 13, together with the academy's connected devices such as phones, computers, printers and the users behind them. From the local network (LAN/institution) you are forwarded to a server (172.16.1.11), which is located in a medicine cabinet inside the academy's sculpture hall. You are now behind the misty glass of the medicine cabinet, surrounded by vials, ampoules and its empty shelves.<br/><br/></p>

<p>* ursuppe.dk is a web application written to solve a specific problem. Its purpose is to reclaim the dissemination of press material from established media on the art scene‡ and put control in the hands of the artists themselves. As a visitor, you can access ursuppe.dk anywhere, mind you, when the institution's electricity is switched on. Here you will find an archive of exhibitions and an exhibition calendar with an integrated map (OpenStreetMap).<br/><br/></p>
